# komgaKomfScripts
These are some scripts to automate adding, removing and updating komf to a system running the swizzin service. 
Please be aware that the reverse proxying and adding to the pannel do not curently work so can be removed from these scripts. Running them as is still works but that functionality is currently broken.
